# CALC Python Interpreter (SPI)

## Overview

This project is a basic arithmetic expression interpreter implemented in Python. It can parse and evaluate mathematical expressions such as `3 + 5`, `7 * (2 + 3)`, and more. The interpreter is built using a custom lexer and parser, following the principles of recursive descent parsing.

## Features

- Supports integer arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports parentheses for grouping operations.
- Handles unary operators (`+` and `-`).

## Supported Tokens

- `INTEGER`: Represents integer values.
- `PLUS`: `+` symbol for addition.
- `MINUS`: `-` symbol for subtraction.
- `MUL`: `*` symbol for multiplication.
- `DIV`: `/` symbol for division.
- `LPAREN`: `(` symbol for left parenthesis.
- `RPAREN`: `)` symbol for right parenthesis.
- `EOF`: End of input.

## Class Descriptions

### `Token`

Represents a token with a type and a value. Tokens are generated by the lexer and used by the parser.

### `Lexer`

Responsible for reading the input text and breaking it down into tokens for the parser to process.

### `Parser`

Takes tokens from the lexer and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on the grammar rules for arithmetic expressions.

### `AST`

A base class for the Abstract Syntax Tree nodes. The specific nodes include `BinOp`, `Num`, and `UnaryOp`.

### `Interpreter`

Traverses the AST and evaluates the expression. This is the core of the interpreter where the actual calculation happens.

### `NodeVisitor`

Helper class that implements the visitor pattern. Used by the interpreter to visit different types of AST nodes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or copy the files into your local environment.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. Enter arithmetic expressions into the prompt `spi> ` to evaluate them.

Example:

```bash
$ python main.py
spi> 3 + 5
8
spi> 7 * (2 + 3)
35
spi> -4 + 6
2
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Running the Program

To run the program, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then, you can enter arithmetic expressions at the `spi>` prompt.
